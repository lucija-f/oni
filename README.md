# ONI
This project was made as a personal final project for a college course. It was made according to my own idea,
as well as design, typography and content. It is the unofficial website of the illustrator Tisja

## While building this web site I have learned how to:
- create a good wireframe
- use Figma to create graphic design work, layouts and wireframe websites
- create responsive web design
- choose the right navigation for a website
- use appropriate web typography and color selection

- create pages Galerija, Proizvodi and DogaÄ‘anja and link them with the Home page
- link footer icons with their respective sites
